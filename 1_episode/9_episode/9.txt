today we gonna make our code clean and create custom hooks 

if you follow single responsibility function then basically you can make the code reusable, maintainable, testable and very easy to debug if there are cases of bug 

single responsibility function is when you breakdown your code just like you are doing right now into smaller components and each component should perform one tasks only. It does not hard and fast rule its meaning is code should be modular simple clean and nice

CUSTOM HOOKS:
a hook is just a javascript function nothing else to create a custom hook create a file in the utils folder and start the name of the file with 'use'. By this react will understand that you have created a hook and use that hook

so we have created useRestaurantMenu.ts in the utility file and its work is to basically fetch the data and give that to RestaurantMenu

to write custom hooks always ask yourself two question what it is asking as a parameter and what it is returning 

there is an evenlistenr called as online to check wether the user is online and offline by checking there internet connection. It is given to us by browser and window function

thats how dino game is made you make a hook to check if its offline or online and when the user is offline you load the dino game

how to optimise the code: always remember to breakdown your code into smaller pieces that instead of one javascript file it should have smaller bundles of js file 

This process is known as chunking/ Code Splitting/ Dynamic bundling / Lazy Loading / onDemand loading/ Dynamic import: to breakdown your app into smaller chunks 

logical bundling is the type of bundling where we bundle the code that provides the logic enough for a feature 

like make my trip has different verticals such as hotels trains etc so for example hotels is a component and it has several mini component or child components of its own same goes for flight tickets and every other component 

so now we gonna do the same thing for our app by creating groceries section

now everytime i dont want to import all my components at once in js for this we will use lazy loading in lazy loading what happens is that the comnponent wont be loaded until its called for example if i dont type
http://localhost:1234/grocery the grocery section wont be loaded

to have this we have to import it using lazy function. Lazy function is a function provided to us by react
 syntax 
 const Grocery = lazy(()=> import(link_to_the_component)) 

 this helps to load the code or bundle only when its needed so realise this that it is separate from our main bundle and it is another bundle now when you click on the link and it isnt able to load or show error here is its explanation

 at the start we have only one file app.js and then we have another file grocery that is called when we click on to it suppose you clicked on to it and that file takes 12ms to load now react see oh where is the file in that 12ms and since our data is coming and it isnt there react throws an error saying that the code isnt there to sort this problem we use something known as  suspense

 suspense it is a component that is given to us by react and you can wrap your component in Suspense and give it a fall back that means what to load until a data comes in 



 const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <AppLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        path: '/',
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: '/about',
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: 'contact',
        element: <Contact />,
      },
      {
        path: '/restaurants/:resId',
        element: <RestaurantMenu />,
      },
      {
        path: '/grocery',
        element: (
          <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loadingg.......</h1>}>
            {' '}
            <Grocery />
          </Suspense>
        ),
      },
    ],
    errorElement: <Error />,
  },
]);

like this
