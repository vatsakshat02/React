<!-- THEORY -->
<!-- So basically the thing is we are able to use elements like createElement and innerHTML because our browser engine
already support these things but for react we have to add something to the project so that it can support react
elements -->

<!-- ___How_to_import_React___ -->
<!-- we will go to cdn in our browser basically cdn is the content delivery network. So when we type cdn React it will
help us to extract react from there. In simple words react is hosted at cdn and it just helps us to host locally -->

<!-- React is just Javascript library and it was written by facebook developers you can checkout the cdn link also read about
crossorigin and links  -->

<!-- There are like two links over here 1st is Core react that gives react components and the second one is React Dom which is used
for Dom manipulation thats why we have two links  -->
